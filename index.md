  Whole Brain Paragraph
  </h3>
When I start an art project I set up all the components I need for the task so I can configure the time needed. Once I have an idea of the direction I want to go in, I have to be sure that my vision is obtainable. After that the creative process can start. I may hit obsticals and I will have to reason with myself by making changes to different aspects of the desired piece and work towards a realistic goal.

<h3>

<h3>
  Elevator Pitch
  </h3>
  Hi, my name is Kasie Cochrane. I am a digital media artist focusing on innovative ways to help people get creative. I feel it is important to bring joy and happiness to others through the process of creating. I want to work on a way to make "getting creative" realistic for all. Do you have any thoughts on that?

<h3>
  Week One Reflection
  </h3>
Throughout the first week of the Digital Media bootcamp I designed a boared game with a group of talented people. I have realized that it is very benificial to have a diverse group of minds working on a project because of the different life experience and new ideas they bring to the table. Being the only female in the group I feel I have somewhat of a responsibility to work even harder and stive to learn and take in as much as I can during the bootcamp. I only hope I can meet my own expectations.

 The duck image is symbolizing myself as I go with the flow of things, unconfidently. I am more or less testing out the waters. The image of the woman has more of a demeanor and purpose. In three years, or so, I hope to be more comfortable with myself and I hope it shows. When it comes to my professionalism, instead of ridding myself of negativity or failure, may I continue to grow though everything I do and build on each experience.

  Summary
  </h3>
  Just looking at my online activity I would say that a recruiter will get that I am generally unexciting. I have the basic set up of social media and a few professional connections. I also do not have much of a tech portfolio because it is more of a fine arts background. The recruiter may take a chance on me since I am at the beginning of a digital media feild.  
  
 <h3>
   Week Two Reflection
  </h3>
  During week two I stared making a commercial with the program Vyond. I really enjoyed the proccess and my final commercial came out very well. Although Vyond is limited on what can be done in the program I feel I definately learned a lot about story boarding, animation and scene development. My next venture is with Unity, a video game developing program. I am nervous for that one because I have heard of how challenging it can be. I will need to watch a ton of tutorials and research some techniques but I have no doubt that I can do this. I think that everything we are doing here in this bootcamp not only teaches us about the awesome programs we use but I realize how much work I have to do on my own, given that we have copius amounts of resources to use to get us where we want to be.

  Week Three Reflection
  </h3>
  Week three was getting projects started that I am interested in and as well as video game building with Unity. In unity I used a packaged game I was able to download and create my own levels using the pre-coded sprites. I created a maze game with many dead ends and obsticals to throw off the player. There were pre-coded enemies I was able to utilize to challenge the players, as well. My sister, brother-in-law and daughter tested my game and were equally impressed and entertained. I began and continued many projects in week three, such as digital illustrations for signage to be put up at the CNM Rio Rancho campus and a audio visualization interactive display for Explora, as well as helping other digital media students on some of their projects. I feel we are getting into the good stuff as we go into week four. I am prepared to be challenged and look forward to learning about some cool software I can use to further my experience.

  Week Four

  <h3>
  Forbidden Island team Activity Reflection
  </h3>
  Upon opening the game I was not sure what to expect. There were so many peices and documentation I felt like it was a good idea to run over the rules as a team first, then we were able to distinguish how to begin. Throughout the game we referred to the manual and discussed every move before we made one as a team to determine what would be best long term and short term. I feel like I played an observer role for the most part, thinking through the moves in my head and when I would notice something that may change the game I would introduce the idea to my team and we would then come to a consensus. Overall, this game was a lot of fun and because of our communication skills and teamwork we were able to beat the game.
  
<h3>
  Week Four Reflection
  </h3>
  During week four, I started to feel how full my plate was getting. I'm not sure if I was overconfident or if Im only second guessing my abilities as an artist now. Either way I can see how far I still have to come. It seems like the seemingly little things can take three to four times as long as I intended. I guess that is what the learning process intails. I am all for it though. This just makes me not want to stop learning and doing. I may be getting carried away because I am forgetting to take care of myself (mentally and physically) during the difficult projects. Im working on it all continuously and trying not to let myself down. Looking forward to week five.

  <h3>
  Week Five Reflection
  </h3>
    Week five went by so quickly. I think I can say I progressed efficiently though. I introduced myself as a Digital Media Intern at the NMTC meet up on Thursday. I networked with some amazing women in Tech. I stepped out of my comfort zone if only for a moment. I want to shout out to Brittany, my captain, she encouraged me to do so. Also I want to shout out to my sister, Noel, without her strength and commitment in her career journey, I wouldn't have found my own strength and couriosity.

<h3>
  Week Six Reflection
  </h3>
  Week six was a great milestone. I had a lot of catching up to do in terms of finishing projects or at least coming close to fininshing some. I am starting to focus on getting my capstone project together and building an actual portfolio. This may take a while. The weeks are flying by and I feel like there is just so much more to wrap my head around. There are 6 weeks left of bootcamp... then the rest of my life.

  Week Seven
  </h2>
  
<h3>
  Week Seven Reflection
  </h3>
  Week Seven I felt my confidence build. I finished editing a couple of videos, continued work on the Nature Walk project, and completed the Explora project (which turned out to be cooler than I thought). I have found that I thoroughly enjoy video editing and plan to work on some more projects utilizing my new skills and push myself to learn and explore more about it. I started to build my portfolio website and I am excited to work on it and some coding skills (can always use a bit of those). In week seven we also got to take a trip to Century 14 movie theatre and watch the new 'How to Train Your Dragon' movie. The computer graphics in that movie were beautifully done and inspires my curiosity. Before this bootcamp I don't remember getting excitingly curious about anything enuogh to pursue research and understanding of the matter. I am amazed and proud of how far I have come in just these short weeks.

  Week Eight

 <h3>
  Week Eight Reflection
  </h3>
  This past week is a blur. I am feeling symptoms of imposter syndrome more this week than I have in any previous weeks. I thought I would be in a more secure place but I don't feel that at the moment. This may be because I only have four weeks left and I can just about see the end of the bootcamp, and I am still unsure of what that means. I have so much more that I want to learn and projects I want to do before this cohort ends. I really need to hone in on what I want to do and figure out where I want to take my new career path.

  Week Nine

<h3>
  Week Nine Reflection
  </h3>
  I'm going to take this opportunity to freak out just a minute.. Who knew I would be interested in the Digital Media feild, much less make my way to these final weeks of Deep Dive Digital Media Bootcamp. Interview day in now less than a week away and shortly after I will be graduating. I still feel as if I have only skimmed the surface of the awesome software I have been using in this course. I continue to get ideas for future projects and I realise how much I want to keep working with these talented people. Again, there is so much I still need to do and learn before I am ready to be out there in the industry, but maybe thats just the imposter syndrome talking.
