  Whole Brain Paragraph
  </h3>
When I start an art project I set up all the components I need for the task so I can configure the time needed. Once I have an idea of the direction I want to go in, I have to be sure that my vision is obtainable. After that the creative process can start. I may hit obsticals and I will have to reason with myself by making changes to different aspects of the desired piece and work towards a realistic goal.

<h3>
  Golden Circle

<h3>
  Elevator Pitch
  </h3>
Hi, my name is Kasie Cochrane. I am a digital media artist focusing on innovative ways to help people get creative. I feel it is important to bring joy and happiness to others through the process of creating. I want to work on a way to make "getting creative" realistic for all. Do you have any thoughts on that?

<h3>
  Week One Reflection
  </h3>
Throughout the first week of the Digital Media bootcamp I designed a boared game with a group of talented people. I have realized that it is very benificial to have a diverse group of minds working on a project because of the different life experience and new ideas they bring to the table. Being the only female in the group I feel I have somewhat of a responsibility to work even harder and stive to learn and take in as much as I can during the bootcamp. I only hope I can meet my own expectations.

 The duck image is symbolizing myself as I go with the flow of things, unconfidently. I am more or less testing out the waters. The image of the woman has more of a demeanor and purpose. In three years, or so, I hope to be more comfortable with myself and I hope it shows. When it comes to my professionalism, instead of ridding myself of negativity or failure, may I continue to grow though everything I do and build on each experience.

  Summary
  </h3>
  Just looking at my online activity I would say that a recruiter will get that I am generally unexciting. I have the basic set up of social media and a few professional connections. I also do not have much of a tech portfolio because it is more of a fine arts background. The recruiter may take a chance on me since I am at the beginning of a digital media feild.  
  
 <h3>
   Week Two Reflection
  </h3>
  During week two I stared making a commercial with the program Vyond. I really enjoyed the proccess and my final commercial came out very well. Although Vyond is limited on what can be done in the program I feel I definately learned a lot about story boarding, animation and scene development. My next venture is with Unity, a video game developing program. I am nervous for that one because I have heard of how challenging it can be. I will need to watch a ton of tutorials and research some techniques but I have no doubt that I can do this. I think that everything we are doing here in this bootcamp not only teaches us about the awesome programs we use but I realize how much work I have to do on my own, given that we have copius amounts of resources to use to get us where we want to be.

  Week Three Reflection
  </h3>
  Week three was getting projects started that I am interested in and as well as video game building with Unity. In unity I used a packaged game I was able to download and create my own levels with using the pre-coded sprites. I created a maze game with many dead ends and obsticals to throw off the player. There were pre-coded enemies I was able to utilize to challenge the players, as well. My sister, brother-in-law and daughter tested my game and were equally impressed and entertained. I began and continued many projects in week three, such as digital artwork for signage to be put up at the CNM Rio Rancho campus and a audio visualization interactive display for Explora, as well as helping other digital media students on some of their projects. I feel we are getting into the good stuff as we go into week four. I am prepared to be challenged and look forward to learning about some cool software I can use to further my experience.
